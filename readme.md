Stop polluting your customers footers with a "made by my agency so I put a cheap link in the footer"-link – that footer is your customers property. Instead, if you want credit – add a simple humans.txt.

All this package does is to add a route for `/humans.txt` and the associated view. "*Why would I ever need a package for a simple thing like this?*" you wonder? Well, so did I until I had done it over 20-30 times – it just saves a few minutes which adds up over time.

## Version Compatibility

See [COMPATABILITY.md](COMPATABILITY.md) for full a full compatability chart. Else Composer should be able to figure it out by itself.

## Install

**Install via composer:**

``` bash
$ composer require olssonm/l5-humans
```

**Publish the view:**

``` bash
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Olssonm\Humans\ServiceProvider"
```

Or by just typing:

``` bash
$ php artisan vendor:publish
```

And selecting `Olssonm\Humans\ServiceProvider`.

## Make it your own

The view is located in your views-folder `/humans/humans.blade.php`.

It's also valid to put this in your `<head>`:

``` html
<link type="text/plain" rel="author" href="http://domain.com/humans.txt" />
```

If you by any chance need to access your `humans.txt` via a named route, that's also possible:

``` html
<link type="text/plain" rel="author" href="{{ route('humans.txt') }}" />
```
